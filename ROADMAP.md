## Roadmap for a Flexible CMS Design (Laravel)

**Document Purpose:** To outline the vision and essential features for a robust and adaptable Content Management System (CMS) built with Laravel. This CMS is designed to empower developers to create diverse web applications, including e-commerce platforms, news/media sites, and booking systems, with maximum control over the frontend presentation.

**Target Audience:** Development Team, Project Stakeholders

**1\. Introduction:**

This document details the requirements and design principles for a new CMS built using the Laravel framework. The core objective is to create a highly flexible and developer-centric CMS that facilitates the rapid development of various types of web applications. A key differentiator is the explicit separation of backend content management from frontend presentation, granting developers complete control over HTML templates and user interface design.

**2\. Overall Goals:**

* **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The CMS should be usable for a wide range of website and web application types (e.g., e-commerce, news/media, booking, informational).  
* **Developer Empowerment:** Provide developers with maximum control over frontend design and implementation without backend theme restrictions.  
* **Modular Architecture:** Design the CMS for easy extensibility and the potential addition of new modules in the future.  
* **Content-Focused Management:** Offer intuitive tools for content creators to manage various types of content (pages, media, blog posts, products, attributes).  
* **Scalability and Performance:** Build the CMS with scalability and performance considerations in mind.  
* **User and Role Management:** Implement a robust system for managing users and their access permissions.

**3\. Core Principles:**

* **Frontend Agnostic:** The CMS will not dictate frontend templating or theming beyond providing data access. Developers are free to integrate any HTML template or frontend framework.  
* **API-Driven Approach:** While not explicitly a headless CMS, the architecture should be conducive to a future where content can be accessed via APIs if needed.  
* **Convention over Configuration:** Leverage Laravel's conventions to streamline development and maintainability.  
* **Security First:** Implement best practices for security throughout the CMS.

**4\. Essential Features and Requirements (Detailed):**

**4.1. Site Settings:**

* **Functionality:** Allow administrators to manage global site information.  
* **Specifics:**  
  * **Essential Settings:** Site Title, Site Logo (upload), Default Meta Description, Default Meta Keywords, Contact Information (email, phone, address), Social Media Links.  
  * **Developer Integration:** Provide clear and consistent methods (e.g., global variables, helper functions) for developers to access these settings within their templates (e.g., echo config('site.title')).  
* 

**4.2. Page Management:**

* **Functionality:** Enable content creators to create and manage website pages.  
* **Specifics:**  
  * **Page Creation:** Intuitive interface for adding new pages.  
  * **Content Fields:**  
    * **Page Title:** For display on the page.  
    * **SEO Title:** Customizable title tag for SEO.  
    * **SEO Description:** Meta description for search engines.  
    * **Keywords:** Meta keywords for SEO.  
    * **Featured Image(s):** Option to upload and associate featured images with a page.

    * **Content Blocks/Sections:** Ability to add various types of content blocks (text, images, galleries, embedded media) within a page.  
  *   
  * **Template Association (Implicit):**  
    * **Backend Process:** When a page is created with a specific "slug" (URL identifier), the system expects a corresponding Blade template file with the same name (e.g., for a page with slug "about-us," the system looks for about-us.blade.php).  
    * **Developer Responsibility:** Developers are responsible for creating these Blade templates and using the available page data (title, content, featured images, etc.) as needed.  
    * **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a default "fallback" template that will be rendered if no corresponding Blade template is found for a given page slug. This prevents broken pages.  
  *   
  * **Status:** Publish, Draft, Archive options for pages.  
* 

**4.3. Media Management (Galleries and Files):**

* **Functionality:** Provide a centralized system for managing various media assets (images, videos, documents).

    * **Dynamic Types/Categorization:** Ability to define custom gallery types or categories (e.g., "Event Photos," "Product Videos," "Home Slider Images").  
    * **Media Association:** Assign uploaded media items to specific galleries or types.  
  *   
  * **Developer Integration:**  
    * **Accessing Media Data:** Provide methods for developers to easily retrieve media information (URL, alt text, title, description) based on gallery type or individual media IDs.  
    * **Example Use Cases:**  
      * Fetching all images marked as "home slider" for use in a homepage carousel.  
      * Displaying all videos categorized under "Product Demos" on a specific page.  
      * Listing all media within a specific gallery on a dedicated gallery page.
